## Leranings 
   Through this project, I learned how to use Django for frontend development by creating a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained experience in integrating Python code into HTML templates to manage logic-based element display. I also learned about Djangoâ€™s core components, including models, views, ModelForms, and the folder structure. Additionally, I explored how to configure settings and work with the Django admin panel, as well as how to create and manage models effectively.
